# Get started with a live boot Kali machine
A live boot machine is **volatile**. This means when you power it off nothing is saved.

This method isn't a long term solution but it gets you set up with a preconfigured and temporary Virtual Machine, perfect for short demos.

**DISCLAIMER: This guide is for a Windows host, if you're on linux or mac things might be slightly different for you.**

1. Download and install VMware Workstation
2. Download the .zip file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ke012EIY1rhIa4cEP8ukfHyK6tuZHaz1/view), this contains the Kali image
3. Extract the .zip file
4. Open VMware, go to (top left corner) File > New Virtual Machine
5. Follow typical installation, set 'Installer disc image file (iso)' to the .iso file you downloaded
6. Ensure maximum disk size is ~40GB (Can be lower but 40GB is safe)
7. Ensure the Allocated Memory/RAM is ~2GB
8. Power on the virtual machine
9. Boot with QUTWH GUI (press enter)
10. Login, username and password are both '**qutwh**'
